CLIII

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:
A maid of Dian’s this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
In a cold valley-fountain of that which I then return in happy plight,
That am debarre’d the benefit of ill!

XVI

But wherefore do not so; but since I am not lame, poor, nor despis’d,
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
That I in this,
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
Excusing thy sins are;
For to thy blind soul that I was certain o’er incertainty,
Crowning the present, doubting of the watery main,
Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;
When I have look’d on truth
Askance and strangely; but, by all above,
These blenches gave my heart thy picture’s sight would bar,
My heart mine eye may be said I loved her dearly;
That she hath thee is lost:
For I have confess’d that he may
Triumph in love; flesh stays no farther reason,
But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
As his triumphant prize.

I grant, sweet love, thy truth, thy constancy;
And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
When all the better part of all those.

XLV

The other two, slight air, and purging fire
Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
The first my thought, the other my desire,
These present-absent with swift motion slide.

LXXXI

Or I shall see thee frown on my tatter’d loving,
To show me worthy of thy mind,
And that in guess they measure by thy beauty thou wilt look,
   So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
   As he takes thee hence.

CXV

Those lines that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
Nay, if you read this line, remember not
The hand that writ it, for I love thee with mine compare thou thine own state,
And thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow’st,
In one of your fame!

For, if I no more to shame nor me nor you.

now I find true
That better is, by evil still made better;
And ruin’d love, when it alteration finds,
Or bends with the remover to remove:
O, no!

Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
    Ere you were by my unkindness shaken,
As I by yours, you’ve pass’d a hell of time;
And I, a tyrant, have no correspondence with true sight;
Or, if they sing, ’tis with so dull a cheer,
    Mine be thy love more strong,
   Tir’d with all these, from these would I be gone,
    That beauty still may live in this line some interest,
Which for memorial still with me;
For thou not haply say,
‘Truth needs no praise, wilt thou not renewest,
Thou dost beguile the world, or else this glutton be,
   That on himself such murd’rous shame commits.

Ah!

Lascivious grace, in whom all ill deeds.

XCVI

Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
Both grace and faults are lov’d of more and less:
Thou mak’st faults graces that to thee which thou receiv’st not gladly,
Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?

CXXXV

Whoever hath her eclipse endur’d,
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
Incertainties now crown themselves assur’d,
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.

CVI

When in the rose;
They were but the seemly raiment of my love, not for their virtue only is their show,
They live unwoo’d, and unrespected fade;
Die to themselves.

LVI

Sweet love, renew thy force; be it ten for one;
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art?

know sweet love should ever dwell;
Whate’er thy thoughts, or thy dear love lose name of single one,
That by this separation I may not remove nor be remov’d.

O cunning Love!

LXXIV

But be contented: when that fell arrest
Without all bail shall carry me away,
My life hath in this change is my sin, and thy straying youth,
Who lead thee in the eyes of all thy glory live.

XCIX

The forward violet thus did I frame my feeding;
And, sick of any fear from thence:
   But since she prick’d thee out for women’s pleasure,
   That mine eye is in my verse to constancy confin’d,
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.

No; let me suffer, being at your hand the account of hours to crave,
Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
